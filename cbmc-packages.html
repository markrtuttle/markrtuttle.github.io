  <p>
    There are packages to install the latest stable release of CBMC
    on most operating systems.
    Instructions for installing these packages are given below.
    They install CBMC into the operating system's equivalent of
    /usr/local/bin.
  </p>

  <p>
    The packages on this page install the latest releases of CBMC
    (which are more recent that the latest stable releases).  In the GitHub
    repository, these are the latest commits on the develop branch.
    These packages come in two forms:
    <ul>
      <li>cbmc: This installs CBMC into the operating system's
        equivalent of /usr/local/bin.  This installs on top of
        any stable version already installed there.  When it is installed, you will
        not need to modify your search path to run CBMC.</li>
      <li>cbmc-latest: This installs CBMC into the operating system's
        equivalent of /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin.  This lets you keep a stable
        version in /usr/local/bin and a latest version in /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin. When it is
        installed, however, you will need to add /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin to
        your search path to run CBMC.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>MacOS installation</h2>

  <p>
    You can install the latest stable version on MacOS with Homebrew.
    Just type:
    <ul>
      <li>brew install cbmc</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can install the latest version as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the cbmc or cbmc-latest link for MacOS at the top of this page.
          This will take you to a list of packages.
          Click on "MacOS cbmc" or "MacOS cbmc-latest" to download the installation package.
      <li>Double-click on the installation package to unzip it and untar it into a folder cbmc or cbmc-latest.</li>
      <li>Add the folder cbmc or cbmc-latest to your PATH.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>

  <h2>Windows installation</h2>

  <p>
    You can install the latest version as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the cbmc or cbmc-latest link for Windows at the top of this page.
          This will take you to a list of packages.
          Click on "Windows cbmc" or "Windows cbmc-latest" to download the installation package.
      <li>Click on the installation package once to unzip it and once to run the unzipped installer.
        The installer is not signed, so Windows will ask you to confirm that you want to run the installer.
        Accept the defaults and install a "typical" installation.
      <li>The cbmc and cbmc-latest installers will put CBMC in "\Program Files\DiffBlue\CBMC" or
        "\Program Files\DiffBlue\CBMC Latest".  Add the directory to your PATH environment variable.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>You must have Visual Studio 2019 installed to run CBMC.
    CBMC is installed as a native Windows application, but it needs
  some VS2019 DLLs to run.  Installing the Community Edition of VS2019 is sufficient.</p>

  <h2>Ubuntu installation</h2>

  <p>
    You can install a stable version on Ubuntu with a Debian package, although this may not install
    the latest stable version. Just type:
    <ul>
      <li>sudo apt-get install cbmc</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can install the latest stable version by adding a PPA to your list of repositories.  Just type:
    <ul>
      <li> sudo apt-get install software-properties-common </li>
      <li> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mt-debian/cbmc-backports </li>
      <li> sudo apt-get update </li>
      <li> sudo apt-get install cbmc </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    You can install the latest version as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the cbmc or cbmc-latest link for Ubuntu at the top of this page.
          This will take you to a list of packages.
        Click on "Ubuntu18 cbmc" or "Ubuntu18 cbmc-latest" to download the installation package for Ubuntu18
        (and do the same for Ubuntu16).</li>
      <li>Unzip the package with "unzip Ubuntu*.zip"</li>
      <li>Install the package with "dpkg -i cbmc*.deb"</li>
      <li>The cbmc package will install into /usr/bin that is already in your PATH.  The cbmc-latest
        package will install into /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin, and you will have to hadd that to your PATH.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Installation notes</h2>

  <p>
    The packages here are generated by GitHub Actions and are hosted on GitHub
    as GitHub Action artifacts.  GitHub has limited storage for artifacts,
    and the latest version may not be the latest possible commit if GitHub
    has run out of storage to hold more distributions.
    GitHub retains artifacts for only 90 days, and
    the stable may not be the actual stable release if it has been longer than
    90 days between releases (it may be a commit to the stable release later
    than the stable release itself).
