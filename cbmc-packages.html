  <p>
    There are packages to install the latest stable release of CBMC
    on most operating systems.
    Instructions for installing these packages are given below.
    They install CBMC into the operating system's equivalent of
    /usr/local/bin.
  </p>

  <p>
    The packages on this page install the latest releases of CBMC
    (which are more recent that the latest stable releases).  In the GitHub
    repository, these are the latest commits on the develop branch.
    These packages come in two forms:
    <ul>
      <li>cbmc: This installs CBMC into the operating system's
        equivalent of /usr/local/bin.  This installs on top of
        any stable version already installed there.  When it is installed, you will
        not need to modify your search path to run CBMC.</li>
      <li>cbmc-latest: This installs CBMC into the operating system's
        equivalent of /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin.  This lets you keep a stable
        version in /usr/local/bin and a latest version in /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin. When it is
        installed, however, you will need to add /usr/local/cbmc-latest/bin to
        your search path to run CBMC.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>Installation notes</h2>

  <p>
    The packages here are generated by GitHub Actions and are hosted on GitHub
    as GitHub Action artifacts.  GitHub has limited storage for artifacts,
    and the latest version may not be the latest possible commit if GitHub
    has run out of storage to hold more distributions.
    GitHub retains artifacts for only 90 days, and
    the stable may not be the actual stable release if it has been longer than
    90 days between releases (it may be a commit to the stable release later
    than the stable release itself).
